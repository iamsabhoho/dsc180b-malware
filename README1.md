# A04 Malware Checkpoint 1

This repository contains the basic structure of our replication project. It includes various python files that have structure in them, and data ingestion methods. 

## Build
If building on dsmlp, run launch-180.sh -G A04_Malware -i edwin5588/dsc180a-docker:latest for the pod, then pull this repository. 
If building on a personal machine, make sure to install Androguard(version: 3.4.0a1), Stellargraph(version: 1.2.1), Networkx(Version 2.2). 


## To Run
```python run.py *args*```

The code in the repo is what we have so far including the utilities functions (helpers) to get paths etc, models we will be using, and a data.py to get our csv from the smali files. Lastly, we have the run.py, where we plan to use it as a main and when it's run it'll display results of the accuracies on the test datasets.
Some arguments currently implemented:
  - test --> tests our data pipeline, from data and feature extraction from a graph to loading it into our model 


## Configuration
Data_params.json in the config folder contains file paths to the directory of benign and malicious apps named popular-apps and malware respectively. From the data_params.json, we input that into a function named "create_data", which will extract features and start creating raw data. The reason is because it's a smaller dataset and easier to run the processes on. The paths are directly linked to the data to the server so there is no need to have local files anywhere. Since the paths to source directories are in the server, run.py will work only when ran on the dsmlp server. After our basic structure of a classifier model, run.py will print the train score and validation score for our model. 


## Submission.json
