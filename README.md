## Introduction
Malicious apps are everywhere, accessible by everyone nowadays. But not everyone has the tool to know whether or not the applications they are downloading are malicious or not. Therefore, we want to create a detection tool by converting Android apps to graphs and perform graph embeddings.


## Data
