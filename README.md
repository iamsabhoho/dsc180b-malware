# A04 Malware Result Replication

This repository contains the basic structure of our replication project. It includes various python files that have structure in them, and data ingestion methods. 

This repository will contain a malware related project based on the paper [**_HinDroid: An Intelligent Android Malware Detection System
Based on Structured Heterogeneous Information Network_**](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/papers/2017-KDD-HINDROID.pdf)

## To Run
```python run.py```

The code in the repo is what we have so far including the utilities functions (helpers) to get paths etc, models we will be using, and a data.py to get our csv from the smali files. Lastly, we have the run.py, where we plan to use it as a main and when it's run it'll display results of the accuracies on the test datasets. 


## Configuration
Data_params.json in the config folder contains file paths to the directory of benign and malicious apps named popular-apps and malware respectively. From the data_params.json, we input that into a function named "create_data", which will extract features and start creating raw data. The reason is because it's a smaller dataset and easier to run the processes on. The paths are directly linked to the data to the server so there is no need to have local files anywhere. Since the paths to source directories are in the server, run.py will work only when ran on the dsmlp server. After our basic structure of a classifier model, run.py will print the train score and validation score for our model. 


## Submission.json
This file contains:
- two file paths to config files
- path of run.py
- directory containing library code
- file path to report.ipynb
- targets


## Responsibilities

Sabrina Ho: created the structure for this repository and developed some basic file parsing functions.
Edwin Huang: developed data ingestion method, parsing functions as well as classifier models and preprocessing pipelines.
